# Soapie - Make the internet more visible

## What is Soapie

Soapie is an open-source browser extension (support Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) to make the internet more accessible for people who are sight impaired. We aim to use the cutting edge AI technology to fill in the blanks of a webpage (e.g. missing alt tag) or remove blocks to improve browsing experience for people in need. When installed and switched on, Soapie will automatically change the html of the webpage so it can be easily accessible for other assisting tools.

## Ideology

Since the popularity of the internet, it has been changing our lives drastically. And for the sight impaired, browsing experience can be quite different form the rest of us.

Nowadays the responsibility of accessibility are upon the web designers and engineers, even thought organisations are advocating the importance of accessibility design, the browsing experience of sight impaired people are still depends of the awareness of the industry. We would like to give this power of having a smooth browsing experience to the users, by working closely with the community, we can build a tool that works on the users' side and will remove the dependences on the web designers.
